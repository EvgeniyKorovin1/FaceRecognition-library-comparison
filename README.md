# FaceRecognition-library-comparison
This project conducted a series of experiments with the Python face-recognition libraries insightface and deepface. The goal of the experiments was to identify the most effective library in the task of verifying a person in a video. Among the tests, we compared how well the libraries can determine the gender of a person in a photograph, what data they can provide if they are unable to process the image, and also assessed the accuracy of verification on a set of three videos.

In the future, the results of these experiments are planned to be reflected in the form of an article for the Habr portal.

## Using
The experiments were conducted using the Google Colaboratory cloud platform. To reproduce the results, you need to run the code blocks in the notebook sequentially. If the program is run under other conditions, you may need to additionally install many libraries, a detailed list can be found in the first block of the notebook with the code. The data set that was used in the experiments is not public, so to run the program you will need to use your own data, the notebook contains a guide on how exactly they can be adapted for use.

## Documentation
For this study, detailed documentation has been compiled, perhaps even somewhat redundant, since it is planned to write an article on this basis. You can read it directly in the [notebook](Code/Experiment-comparing-libraries.ipynb) with experiments, each stage is accompanied by explanations, descriptions of the actions taken and the results obtained.
